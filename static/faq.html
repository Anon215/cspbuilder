            <h2>What is CspBuilder?</h2>

            <p>
                CspBuilder stands for Content Security Policy builder, or web application for collecting
                and analysing CSP violation reports. It works by collecting reports sent by browsers rendering
                your pages, lets you review the sources of would-be-blocked content and eventually fine-tune
                the CSP installed on your page.

            <h2>What are the terms of the service?</h2>

            <p>
                Currently CspBuilder is an free service available to everyone in the web security
                community. As it's still experimental and sometimes coping with large bursts of
                reports from new websites joining in, the database may be cleared at any time (I will
                try to preserve your known list records and other settings though).
            </p>

            <p>
                There's almost no authentication &mdash; so you should perhaps assume that anyone can view
                reports from your website if they know your "page identifier" (which is not very hard to find
                taking into account it's announced in the CSP header). If there's such need, some kind of
                access control will be added to the analytics console.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reports collector API is currently filtering received items to prevent clogging the database
                with continuous streams of repeated, identical records. Reports from sources you have previously
                approved or rejected in the console are <em>not saved</em> to the database, so you will only see
                only unclassified reports there. Reports older than 3 days are discarded.
            </p>

            <p>
                There's also a simple quota &mdash; when number of reports for single identifier exceeds 1 million
                the API will still accept them, but they will not be saved to the database. Remember that you can easily
                reduce the number of reports in database by simply accepting or rejecting the ones that come most
                frequently.
                Each time you do this, the matching old reports get reclassified and make space for the new, yet
                unclassified
                ones.

            <h2>Enforcement mode</h2>

            <p>
                Content Security Policy can be announced by websites in two modes: <strong>enforcement</strong>
                and <strong>report-only</strong>. The formed happens if you annonuce the policy via <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
                header, the latter is set with <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Enforcement is, well, enforcement &mdash; if your CSP is not allowing <em>everything</em> that needs to
                be
                allowd your website will just stop rendering. In report-only mode though the browsers will report
                whatever
                it <em>would</em> block in the JavaScript console and to the CSP violation reports. CspBuilder makes use
                of these
                reports to gradually learn what content the website really loads and allow you to make decisions which
                of these
                should be allowed.
            </p>

            <p>
                In reality, this is more difficult than it looks at first look. Most websites will load much more
                content than
                is directly visible in their HTML code. It's because when you start using
                JavaScript frameworks or 3
                <small><sup>rd</sup></small>
                party code (like Google Adsense) it becomes
                a chain reaction. One script loads another one, then another one, then that one creates some additional
                HTML elements, open frames etc.

            <h2>Default empty policy</h2>

            <p>
                CspBuilder will initially recommend you a very restrictive Content Security Policy that basically
                disallows
                any content from loading, but in report-only mode, such as this one:
            </p>

<pre>
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: report-uri //cspbuilder.info/report/487710497807711360/; connect-src 'none' ; child-src 'none' ; font-src 'none' ; form-action 'none' ; frame-ancestors 'none' ; frame-src 'none' ; img-src 'none' ; media-src 'none' ; object-src 'none' ; script-src 'none' ; style-src 'none' ; default-src 'none' ; reflected-xss block; referrer origin-when-cross-origin;
</pre>

            <p>
                This very restrictive policy usually results in an avalanche of CSP violation reports
                which CspBuilder happily captures to find out what should be allowed.
                If you ever need to revert to this empty policy after you've collected some events you can do so by
                selecting the
                <strong>Default (empty) policy</strong> in the <a href="#/policy/">Policy generation</a> tab.

                CSP standard version 1.1 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#directive-referrer">introduces</a> a new
                directive <code>referrer</code> to instruct browser on the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer">HTTP Referer</a> behaviour. Details of this

                Content Security Policy was initially implemented as an experimental feature and various browsers
                recognized it
                in different HTTP headers. The standard on is <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> and it's what should
                be used
                by default.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are also two less known variants <code>X-Content-Security-Policy</code> and </code><code>X-Webkit-CSP</code>
                that were used by some browsers at some stage of development. Please see

                introduces a new CSP directive <code>strict-mixed-content-checking</code> that is intended to be
                used as a catch-all hint on pages that do not set a granular policy for each external resource.
                If enabled, compliant browsers will reject external content loaded from
                destinations of less security level that the origin &mdash; for example, images on a TLS page

                Upcoming <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/">Content Security Policy 1.1</a> introduces a number
                of new security controls that are being gradually introduced by browsers. Announcing those features
                in CSP header usually won't have major side effects. You may however expect a potentially large number
                of warnings in the JavaScript console about unsupported CSP options:</p>

            <p>
                <code>The 'referrer' Content Security Policy directive has the invalid value "origin-when-cross-origin".
                    Valid values are "no-referrer", "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "origin", and "unsafe-url".
                    Note that "origin-when-cross-origin" is not yet supported.</code>

            <h2>Inline and eval() detection</h2>

            <p>
                CSP reports are quite confusing when inline code or <code>eval()</code> events are blocked: in both
                cases there will be just an empty <code>blocked-uri</code> in the report and no other clue to
                identify which one is really being reported. This was actually
                <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/issues/52">reported</a> as an issue to the W3C but as
                of CSP 1.1 it's how it is.
            </p>

            <p>
                The method to work around this limitation is to set <strong>two CSP headers</strong>, both almost
                identical, with the only differences being the reporting URL and policy on the inline/eval:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li><code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: report-uri
                    //cspbuilder.info/report/0681611143285408602/noscripteval/; script-src 'unsafe-inline' ...</code>
                <li><code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: report-uri
                    //cspbuilder.info/report/0681611143285408602/noscriptinline/; script-src 'unsafe-eval' ...</code>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As result, the browser will report instances of blocked <code>eval()</code> to URL 1 and rule 2 will
                report instances of blocked
                inline code to URL 2. CspBuilder takes the last word in the URL and turns it into a <strong>tag</strong>
                field. This way
                it can distinguish these events: an empty <code>blocked-uri</code> report with <code>noscripteval</code>
                means blocked <code>eval()</code>,
                the other is for blocked inline code.
